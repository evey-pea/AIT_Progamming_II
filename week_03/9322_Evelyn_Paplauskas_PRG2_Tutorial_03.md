# C++ Programming Week 3 – Functions 1

## Task1

Write a program with a function mySum that takes two integer parameters, adds
them together, and then returns the sum. The program should ask the user for
two numbers, then call the function with the numbers as arguments, and tell the
user the sum.

```
Please enter first number: 10
Please enter second number: 5
Sum of 2 numbers is: 15
```

### Solution Task 1

```cpp

```

## Task2

Basically the same as exercise 1, but this time, the function that adds the
numbers should be void, and takes a third, pass by reference parameter; then
puts the sum in that.

### Solution Task 2

```cpp

```

## Task3

Write a program with a function myCount that take one integer parameter and
one char parameter. The program should ask the user for both inputs. Character
parameter can be ‘I’ or ‘D’ which stand for increment and decrement. E.g. If the
function is called with 5 and ‘I’ it should return 6. On the other hand if ‘D’ was
input, it should return 4.

```
Please enter number: 5
Please enter counting condition (I/D): I
Next number is: 6
```

### Solution Task 3

```cpp

```

## Submission
- Each task should be named as ```<student_id>_<student_name>_tut3_task
<task_number>```. E.g. ```1234_Kriss_tut3_task1```
- Compress your entire project folder and name it as ```<student_id>_
<student_name>_tut3.zip``` E.g. ```1234_Kriss_tut3.zip``` then upload the zip file
to canvas.
- Due date is Week 4, 11:59PM
